----------------------------
This program allows Karel to run a "Steeple Chase" (like a hurdles race, 
but with arbitrarily large hurdles) where: 
1. Karel starts at position (1, 1), facing East (aka right). 
2. The steeple chase is guaranteed to be 9 columns long. 
3. There can be arbitrarily many hurdles that can be of arbitrary size, 
    located between any two corners in the world. 
4. Karel should "jump" each hurdle one at a time and pick up the beeper.
5. karel should end up facing East at the bottom right corner of the world.
